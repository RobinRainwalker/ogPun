html/bootstrap for styling, javascript/jquery/express for middleware, postgreSQL for database. 

Packages used - 'moment' - because getting quote of the day required dealing with timestamps and as long as I had the timestamps I used the fromNow method to create a human friendly timestamp on comments

Understanding and applying abstraction of concepts was key to my coding of this project. I took several steps back, did research on proper methodology of tackling a full stack web development application, focused on extended my existing understanding of manipulating data through the MVC process and then whiteboarded every step and every need of the program before sitting down to write the code. 

The hardest part of the process (besides debugging which I'm much much better at) was correctly passing the time from one language to another, which wound up being difficult even with the moment package. The other particularly difficult task was correctly getting voting to work and even more so, adding functionality that allows a given user to only add one groan and/or giggle to a comment.

Completed tasks: 
	Functioning user signup, user login and user authentication as well as password encryption
	Successful API request that changes based on the day
	Successful commenting
	Successful voting on giggles and groans
	Successful two page full stack application
	Learned and implemented bootstrap

Unresolved issues: 
	Comments display the logged in user's username no matter who made the comment.
	Comments carry over from day to day.
		late stage discovery and bigger priories left this these issues to be fixed before a full deployment can be made.
	Deleting and updating models were made but not utilized in the current version of the app

5 minutes: A presentation deck - Google Slides, Keynote, PowerPoint

At least 5 slides
Use easy-to-understand language and avoid too much "technical" terminology
Include wireframes that shows your app
Answer the following questions: - What is the your app about? - What features does it include? - Were there any constraints you had to work with? (e.g. technological, timing, content, etc.) - Is there any other information you think might help us (your stakeholders) understand what you've built?
